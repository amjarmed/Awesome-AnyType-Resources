# 🧠My thoughts about AnyType and How I Learned It Quickly  

- how anytype store pages?
- sets vs collections?
- how to create a database  ?
- how to create Folder?
- how it connects pages?
- why it use programming naming rather than everyday words [collections, sets, object, graph, relations, type, space, ...]?

## 🎛 AnyType Categories

- **Groups** :
  - Set : filtered by one Object type (notes...)
  - Collections: organize a variety of different objects types and `store` them in one place.

- **Objects**: page, books, Notes...

## 🗄 Object In AnyType

- At Anytype we have created the concept that everything you create is an Object. Pages, Notes, Recipes, Books, Movies, Audio, Humans, everything!
- These are all Objects that are organized and categorized by Types.
- You can connect different Types by Relations and see how this is visualized on the Graph.

## ✏ Blocks

- Your object is made up of different types of blocks to organize your information, and the place where all of these Blocks live together is called the Canvas. Anytype's block-based editor works very similarly to that of blogging sites or website builders.

## Types

- Types are the classification system we use to categorize Objects
- Every object has a Type, which is defined at the time of Object creation (and can be changed later)
- Different Types are used to define Objects which are categorically different from each other
- examples of Types you might have in your graph:Task,Note, Book, Movie, Idea

## Relations

-Relations are key to organizing and connecting your Objects and knowledge in Anytype. There are two functions that Relations serve in Anytype

- Defining attributes: You can use Relations to define the characteristics of a certain Object.
  - For example, when creating a Task in Anytype, you can add Relations such as Status: Done/Not Done, or Priority: Low, Medium, or High.
  - If we were to imagine a database, Relations represent the column headers to each row (where column A is the Object).
  - Once you have set your attributes, it becomes possible to sort and filter your Objects according to the Relations you've defined in Set View.
- Defining connections: You can also use Relations to link one Object to another.
  - Returning to the example of a Task, you can add the Relation: Assignee, and assign another Object in your Anytype to this task.
  - As above, you can view the Assignees as Relations in Set view, or in Graph view.

## 🗄 Set In AnyType

- A live search of all Objects which share a common Type or Relation
- Sets don't store Objects like regular databases.
- Sets serve two primary functions: Organizing and Accessing Objects and Editing Objects quickly.
- to find all pages where type is Notes, Create a `Set` based on Type which will display every Note you've created in Anytype.
- If you have specific `notes` you'd like to frequently access, you can filter them based on Relations you've added to these notes using Set.
- set : For instance: Creation Date, Tags, or Priority. (In this sense, Relations behave like attributes).
- You can then pin your `Set` to your Favorites menu, where it will sit on your Sidebar, acting like a folder for all Objects that meet certain criteria.
- Sets also provide a way to quickly edit Objects in a list View.
- You can use multi-select Objects in Sets to delete multiple Objects at once, or to batch update the Object Type. Any Relations added to a Set in the Relation Menu (top right), will be adopted by all new Objects created with the "+ New Object" button.
- **Toggle & Add Relations to Objects via Sets** :
  - Instead of adding Relations one-by-one to Objects, you can batch-add them to your Set by clicking the filters on the right side.
  - Here you can toggle on/off any Relations that you would like to see, add another Relation or new relation, and edit the View of the Set here.
  - You can add any Relations to be automatically added to your Objects, by adding them in the creation process of your Type.

## 📁 Collections

- A folder-like structure where where you can visualize and batch edit objects of any type
- These are similar to Sets in their appearance and layout, however functioning differently.
- Contrary to Sets, Collections are not filtered by Object Type but are in fact `open` to any Object Type.
- Collections can be used to organize a variety of different objects and store them in one place.
- You are not restricted to viewing only one Object Type at a time, this means you can have multiple different types within one collection.
- In a Collection, you can organize all of this Types together seamlessly.
